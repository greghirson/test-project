# California Grapes

## Cabernet Sauvignon

Cabernet Sauvignon is the son (daughter?) of Cabernet
Franc and Sauvignon blanc. It is grown extensively in
the North Coast (Napa, Sonoma, Lake, Mendocino, and many
other counties). Cabernet grapes from Napa fetch among
the highest prices of any agricultural crop per  ton in
the country (I predict).

## Sauvignon blanc

Sauvignon blanc is a white grape variety traditionally grown
in Bordeaux but now grown all over the world.

## Syrah

Black pepper and meatiness/gaminess are two of the characteristics
often used to describe Syrah. Syrah from California achieves these
flavors much less frequently than Syrah from either France or
New Zealand. Craggy Range Block 11 Syrah is one of my favorites.
